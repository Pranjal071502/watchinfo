      <h2>Fossil Group, Inc.</h2>
      <p>
        Fossil Group, Inc., founded in 1984 by Tom Kartsotis in Richardson, Texas, is a prominent American fashion designer and manufacturer specializing in watches, jewelry, and accessories. The company emerged with a vision to offer affordable, stylish timepieces, blending vintage-inspired designs with modern trends.
      </p>
      <h3>Company Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Initially operating under the name Overseas Products International, Fossil gained recognition for its retro-themed watches. In 1990, the company expanded its product line to include leather goods under the Fossil brand and introduced the Relic line of watches. Fossil went public in 1993, marking a significant milestone in its growth trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Fossil has strategically acquired several brands to diversify its portfolio. Notable acquisitions include the Swiss brand Zodiac Watches in 2001, Michele Watch in 2004, and Skagen Designs in 2012. In 2015, Fossil acquired Misfit, a wearable technology company, for $260 million, signaling its entry into the smartwatch market.
